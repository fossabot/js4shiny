## Literate JavaScript Programming with R Markdown

This package includes several components that enable the use of R Markdown for literate programming with JavaScript. The first of these is the R Markdown HTML format, `js4shiny::html_document_js()`. In this R Markdown format, JavaScript chunks are executed in the browser and logged messages and outputs are displayed in the document, much like a standard R chunk.

For more information see `vignette("literate-javascript")`.
